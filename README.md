ðŸŽ¯ AIM-

To implement various matrix operations in C++ including:
Matrix input and display
Matrix addition
Matrix multiplication
Diagonal element addition
Transpose of a matrix
Element comparison between rows

ðŸ“š THEORY-

Matrices are fundamental data structures in programming used to store data in tabular form. Operations on matrices like addition, multiplication, diagonal sums, transposition, and comparison are essential in solving problems in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. These tasks are achieved using 2D arrays and nested loop constructs in C++.

ðŸ§  CONCEPT-
2D Arrays: Used to represent matrices.
Nested Loops: For traversing rows and columns.
Matrix Addition: Element-wise sum of two matrices.
Matrix Multiplication: Dot product of rows and columns.
Transpose: Switching rows with columns.
Diagonal Addition: Summing specific index-based elements.
Comparison: Matching elements across different rows.

âœ… CONCLUSION-

Matrix input and display was successfully achieved using nested loops.
Matrix addition and multiplication were correctly implemented using appropriate logic.
Diagonal elements were accurately identified and summed.
Matrix transposition was performed by switching indices.
Elements in the first two rows were effectively compared.
All operations demonstrated proper use of 2D arrays, conditionals, and control structures in C++.
