ðŸŽ¯ AIM
To develop and understand basic matrix operations using C++ programming, including:

Taking input and displaying a matrix

Adding two matrices of the same dimension

Multiplying two matrices (2x2)

Calculating sums of primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix

Computing the transpose of a matrix

Comparing elements of the first row with those of the second row in a matrix

ðŸ“š THEORY
Matrices are two-dimensional arrays representing data in rows and columns. Matrix operations are vital in various computational tasks:

Input/Output: Handling matrix data entry and formatted display.

Addition: Element-wise sum, requiring matrices of the same size.

Multiplication: Each element of the result matrix is the sum of products from row elements of the first and column elements of the second matrix.

Diagonals: Primary diagonal elements have equal row and column indices; secondary diagonal elements' indices sum to (n - 1) for an nÃ—n matrix.

Transpose: Flips the matrix over its diagonal by swapping rows and columns.

Comparison: Checking for common elements between two rows to identify matches.

These operations build foundational knowledge for more complex algorithms and applications.

ðŸ§  CONCEPT
2D Arrays: Store matrix elements in contiguous memory with rows and columns.

Nested Loops: Double loops iterate over rows and columns for input, processing, and output.

Element-wise Operations: Used for addition and comparison by matching indices.

Triple Nested Loops: Essential for matrix multiplication to sum products over the shared dimension.

Index-Based Logic: For accessing diagonal elements and performing transpose operations.

Conditional Checks: Used during comparison to detect matching elements between rows.

Mastering these concepts enables efficient manipulation and processing of matrix data.

âœ… CONCLUSION
Successfully accepted and displayed matrix inputs using nested loops.

Implemented matrix addition by summing corresponding elements, ensuring dimension compatibility.

Performed matrix multiplication by calculating dot products of rows and columns correctly.

Calculated sums of both primary and secondary diagonals using index properties.

Transposed matrices by swapping row and column indices, demonstrating array index manipulation.

Compared elements of the first two rows and accurately identified common values.

Overall, these programs solidify understanding of matrices, loops, arrays, and basic algorithmic thinking in C++.
